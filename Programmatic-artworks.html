            <h2>Programmatic-artworks</h2>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;">
            In the realm of artistic expression, I, as a scientist and artist, find myself at the convergence of two seemingly disparate worlds—science and art. 
            Armed with a formal education in scientific methodologies and the nuanced language of code typically employed in scientific figure creation, 
            I embark on a purposeful journey to transcend the conventional boundaries that delineate art from science. 
            The motivation underlying the creation of programmatic images for artistic purposes is deeply rooted in the ambition to navigate 
            beyond the classic art-science dichotomy. 
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"></p>
            My background in science has equipped me with the precision and discipline inherent in data 
            representation through code. However, rather than confining myself to the traditional role of figures in scientific discourse, 
            I am driven to harness the inherent creative potential within the realm of programming. The motivation, therefore, lies in the deliberate and 
            formal intention to reframe code as an instrument of artistic expression, shifting its purpose from a tool of analysis to a conduit for aesthetic innovation.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"></p>
            In this exploration, the programmed lines of code cease to be mere data points; they transform into strokes on a canvas, each algorithmic nuance contributing 
            to a larger narrative. The aim is not simply to create visually arresting compositions but to challenge preconceptions and dismantle the entrenched dichotomy 
            between the structured rigor of science and the boundless creativity of art.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"></p>
            The challenge I willingly undertake is one of synthesis—to merge the systematic precision of code with the unrestrained imagination that defines artistic 
            endeavour. Every pixel, every line of code becomes a deliberate choice, an intentional step toward transcending the limitations of disciplinary boundaries. 
            This artistic endeavour serves as a testament to the belief that creativity knows no bounds and that the amalgamation of science and art can yield 
            a rich tapestry of expression.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"></p>
            Furthermore, the motivation extends beyond personal artistic expression. The programmed images become ambassadors, emissaries conveying a message of 
            collaboration and integration. By venturing into uncharted territories, I aspire to contribute to a cultural shift where the dichotomy between art and 
            science is viewed as a spectrum, fostering an environment that values the harmonious coexistence of these seemingly disparate realms.
            </p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Andale Mono', monospace;"></p>
            In conclusion, the creation of programmatic images for artistic purposes represents a formal and purposeful commitment to transcend the classic art-science 
            dichotomy. As a scientist navigating the world of artistic expression, I endeavour to redefine the narrative, demonstrating that the synthesis of code and 
            creativity can yield profound and transformative results, pushing the boundaries of what is conventionally perceived as achievable within the realms of both 
            science and art.

            Manifesto generated with ChatGPT3.5 on January 13th 2024 using the following prompt: “Please write a text that motivates the creation of programmatic images 
            for artistic purposes by me. The background of the artist is a scientist, that uses programming and code typically used to create figures in a scientific 
            context for the creation of artworks. The text should be formal, and highlight that the aim is to go beyond the classic art-science dichotomy.”</i>
